  ## Description
  This project was a way to learn how to use Mongoose and mongoDB to create a backend for a social media application. There is no User interface it is simply backend models and routing. This project was a good way for me to learn about NoSQL databases. The application features Users, users can post thoughts, add friends, remove thoughts, remove friends, update thoughts, and more!
